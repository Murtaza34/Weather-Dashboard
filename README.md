# Weather Dashboard

Developed a weather dashboard that provides up-to-date information about the current weather conditions in any city. The dashboard features an intuitive interface that displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a five-day forecast, all in one place.

Users can enter the city name and the dashboard will display the current date using the Moment.js library. The entered city name is also stored in the local storage, so the user does not have to enter it again every time they use the dashboard. The elements on the dashboard are dynamically generated using jQuery, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. 

The weather data is obtained from a third-party API, providing accurate and up-to-date information about the current weather conditions. The dashboard's design is clean and user-friendly, making it a reliable tool for anyone looking to stay informed about the weather.

#### The application will inlclude the following:

- Display current date
- Buttons generated after users input
- Input field (where users can enter their tasks)
- Save button (To store user input locally)
- clear button (To remove user data from local storage)
